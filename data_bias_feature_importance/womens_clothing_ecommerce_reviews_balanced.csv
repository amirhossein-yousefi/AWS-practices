-1,Unfortunately this one is going back. the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back.,Blouses
-1,"I so wanted to love this tank  and was so excited to get it in the mail! i got a size small (my usual) and it ran so large i wasn't even sure an xs would've fit properly. the material looked lighter and blouse-y on the model  but in person is much thicker and sort of ""hangs"". underarms run large and are gaping from the body. i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it  but it just can't work on me!",Blouses
-1,I bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints. however  they are too sheer. i don't want to wear a tank top  but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer. i can also see the fabric tearing easily  it is too delicate. i sent both colors back. what a waste because the prints and colors are good. these tops are also not for busty ladies. i have a big bust  and the top part didn't cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st,Blouses
-1,Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back  but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.,Blouses
-1,This didn't work for me.  the piece looked cheap  rode very high...needed to be longer.  the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes.  it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece.  this went back.,Blouses
-1,This is a great top but it is really big. i have a similar top from the same brand and the size small fits as expected. this top is easily 2 inches wider everywhere. i would love to exchange it for an extra small  but am afraid that even that size would be too large. the blue pattern is beautiful and the fabric is light and airy  which is perfect for warm days  but the size issue is out of control!,Blouses
-1,Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.,Blouses
-1,I saw this top online and ordered immediately!  i loved the color  lace  and unique details.  sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster!  the lace is stiff and doesn't lay softly  and is very rough against your skin.  the style ( and i like shorter style tops) is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way. .....  that although i am so in love with this color  i would be embarrassed to wear this top in public.  it could have been fantastic  if the lace was softer  and some a,Blouses
-1,I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.,Blouses
0,This top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model. it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom  which normally i like  but not this time. sad.,Blouses
0,First off  the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling  the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however  i just couldn't get past the fit issue  which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest  and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me  but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else  but i had to ret,Blouses
0,I love this blouse but my normal size didn't even come close to fitting me. i think i would have had to go 2 sizes up. too bad cause it is a beautiful top. not good for us busty girls though.,Blouses
0,The shirt is great except for the arms!! the band around the arms are tight and it makes the arm holes gape weirdly unless you are standing with your arms straight down by your side.,Blouses
0,I liked the quality of the top and the design. but when i got a top that fit well across the chest  it was shorter than i usually like my tops  so i will be returning it.,Blouses
0,According to the sizing chart i should be an 8 or 10. i ordered a 10  but i could not get the blouse zipped up around the ribcage  the one spot i don't keep any fat. i brought it to the store to exchange for a 12  but i couldn't breath with the 12 on. for reference i am 34ddd. it was the 34 part that didn't fit  the ddd would have fit fine  i think.,Blouses
0,I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.,Blouses
0,This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.,Blouses
0,I suppose i would have kept this top i hadn't been misled about the color. i don't like ecru or eggshell--  the description said it was black and white.,Blouses
1,My heart's a-flutter for this top. the fabric has an excellent weight and feel to it  and the little  fluttery cap sleeves are to die for. i've ordered this in almost every color because it is such a great staple. it is a gorgeous pairing with the marala knit skirt (especially in green ) and the double stripe jacquard skirt  but i'm certain it would be a perfect choice for any pencil skirt. it's so flattering and comfortable  with a neckline that is perfect for single strand pearls or similar le,Blouses
1,I ordered this in the lavender and love the rich color! looks great with my blonde hair. the bell sleeves  which are all the rage right now  add to the feminine look. i wore it with jeans and espadrilles for a fab boho look!,Blouses
1,I am loving this shirt. i thought it would look ridiculously long on me but it does not. for me this is a great substitute for the cloth & stone fringed plaid buttondown dress. it's definitely not a dress but is long enough to pull off the layered look of wearing a t-shirt and this on top. it will be a great piece for the fall given how incredibly soft and light weight it is. highly recommend.,Blouses
1,This blouse is gorgeous on i purchased at my local store i noticed it was $29.99 + 30% = $21.00 omg it's so nice on it's soft and comfortable and the gold threading make it sunning it does run a little small in the chest area,Blouses
1,"This tunic is a great way to wear the plaid trend right now without it being the traditional collared shirt. it's fun  comfortable and has great style. the first time i wore it i got tons of compliments! i'm 5'8"" and the back of the shirt goes to the back of my knees  i usually wear a size 12 and the large fit great!",Blouses
1,I snagged this top with the 25% off sale and it's adorable. i got the white  and it goes great with some skinny jeans or tucked into a skirt. i found it ran true to size. my only complaint is that like some other reviewers have stated  it does wrinkly very easily. and i would say for full price i don't think the quality is worth the cost  but on sale  it's a great shirt.,Blouses
1,Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.,Blouses
1,I am most pleased with this tunic. purchased it in red. nice quality and very comfortable casual top. it has a flattering cut that isn't boxy for a long tunic so it's flattering. the weight of the fabric is substantial but not heavy or stiff so it doesn't add any bulk which is a bit slimming. it would work well for a wide variety of body types. i may buy the blue as well.,Blouses
1,I ordered the xl and the colors are just as pictured. the material is so soft. the problems: too short and too small. i'm a little over 5 ft. 5 inches and this top ran so short on me. i wish there were three more inches of material and then it would have been great. it was cut a little tight along the shoulder line too. i was so disappointed that this couldn't work on me. i like a romantic style  especially for comfortable basics. but  this was a pass for me. i had to return it. the ruffles on t,Blouses
-1,There is no way this is worth the price. i was deeply disappointed when it arrived. the material is thin and feels cheap. i love the design  and anna sui  but this is just so overpriced.,Dresses
-1,This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size  but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty  but background is more of a muddy gray  then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available  i'd have exchanged it  but it is going back.,Dresses
-1,"I saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it. when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes - my regular and one size larger. when i got them  i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect! beautiful pattern and material. light and airy. sexy with the low-cut ""keyhole."" i am sooo happy with my purchase.",Dresses
-1,So disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days. especially at this price point. the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful  but i will never spend two hundred dollars (or even half that) on a poly dress. please add more linen  cotton  and silk!,Dresses
-1,I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8  went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type  but compared to the model  this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.,Dresses
-1,This dress is gorgeous as displayed at store. color is vibrant  but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily. i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived. the top is very wide and best to wear strapless.,Dresses
-1,The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like.   sending back,Dresses
-1,This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0  so i'm not sure who this may look good on.,Dresses
-1,Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!,Dresses
0,"This dress has great potential. i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off. as a previous review stated  it's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree  the hem is also funky. i am still deciding if i want to keep it  but if i do  i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too. for reference  i'm 5'3"" and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0.",Dresses
0,It looks so cute and i love the detail on this dress but it was not flattering on me. light summer dress and that was exactly what i needed but i had to exchange it with something else.,Dresses
0,If you're tall  this dress sits up too high-waisted and this makes your waist look big. it's also kind of thin material on top and stretchy  so even though i'm small chested it made my shoulders and chest look large  but not on a good way. in other words  this dress made me look fat. the length is not bad for taller gals. all in all  not worth it.,Dresses
0,I have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version  but it just didn't work nearly as well. the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra. the black pattern was also nothing special. i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel - would consider getting it if it went on sale.     i tried on the small and the extra small - didn't notice a difference between the two. i think i have on the xs in the photo.,Dresses
0,"I don't know that i'll keep this  although i really want to. i love the style and the fabric  and the length is perfect for me (i'm 5'3"" and i ordered the petite length - it hits me below the knee). as another reviewer mentioned  this dress runs small in the chest area and does not provide any stretch. luckily for me  that wasn't an issue.    my trouble is this: the liner stops just above the slits on the side  and it's way more noticeable in person than in the photo. the liner is sewn in and yo",Dresses
0,After reading all the reviews  i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso,Dresses
0,This pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin. i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool doesn't bother me too much. i'm not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress  even with the slip  which doesn't cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off. i decided to keep and wear as an autumn/winter dress in which i will remove the slip  wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea,Dresses
0,Just got this dress in an xl. i've never ordered from retailer before so i expected their clothes to run small. i was wrong. it's a beautiful high quality dress but i think it's just too big. i may end up exchanging it for a l. definitely size down in this dress!,Dresses
0,I really like the color and flow of this dress. the dress itself fit well however the slip was extremely tight through the bust. i have a large bust at 34d however most dresses are still wearable especially flowy dresses. unfortunately i had to return this one because of the slip.,Dresses
1,Purchased this in the burnt orange color - very nice!  will be lightweight for our hot  humid summers but has a bit of pizazz with the lace up front.  the slip is nicely made with strap attachments in the shoulders so they do not slip.  i wear a ton of dresses in the summer so this will definitely be a go to item for all the horse races we attend.   looking forward to snagging a nice derby style hat to match!,Dresses
1,I really like this dress. it has a very flattering cut and a stretchy forgiving fit so you could go your normal size or up a size and both would fit great. i got the red (orange) and i have worn it once and got 3 compliments in the few hours i was out.  great buy! especially on sale ;),Dresses
1,"I see me wearing this dress with more of an edgey look - not going for romantic. smoky eye  skinny dark jeans under it and pumps. swings further from body than i thought.  i'm 5'7""  wear a 34b and am typically a size 2. that's the size i bought. fits well and while pretty  it's made with heft ... not overly delicate - can't see this snagging. it's more of a cotton lace which is why it looks cool with skinny jeans. detail at the neck gives it more interest.",Dresses
1,Simple  classic  figure flattering  and reasonably priced!,Dresses
1,"Was so glad i gave this dress a chance - it's adorable! it does run large. i am 5'6""  125lb and the 2 fits perfectly. it is super comfortable. i am taking away a star only because it doesn't have pockets - with all of the fabric - how were pockets left out?",Dresses
1,The fabric is breathtaking  both the jewel tone colors and the burnt velvet that would flatter any skin tone. as usual  eva franco clothes run small so i went up a size  size regular 6 (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips) fit well  the hem is below my knees  appropriate for work. but i think it would look better as a skirt or a sheath dress. the top part looks strange  does not enhance any curve and turns the dress to frumpy on short folks like me  thus one star off.,Dresses
1,"I'm glad they put up some pix of non-models looking cute in this dress  as it's taken a beating in the reviews! i measure 34(a)-27-35 and have no problems with the size s fit at all. it's drapey but not voluminous  with no pulling at the hips. the ""folded"" detail up at the top does call attention to the shoulders  but not in a bad way. the pleated neckline is cute on a small chest  and the red pattern/palette is awesome. love the length too -- i am 5'4"" & the size s hits me just above the knee.",Dresses
1,If you are curvy  this dress is for you. every details is flattering  from the seams to the fit-and-flare cut. true to size. this dress will easily cross seasons. love it!,Dresses
1,Because of how much i have been buying recently  i didn't *want* to like this dress. i just tried it on because it's such a classic dress. i'll probably wear it all year-round  dress it up or down  and it'll probably last for ages. so i tried it and it's cute. and flattering. and practical. and the scallop neckline in the back is just enough of a tease to be fun without being too obvious.

-1,Seemed pretty shapeless which surprised me because of the design. perhaps it was just too big. returned it.,Fine gauge
-1,I know this is supposed to look oversized  and i own a few oversized ponchos  but this takes oversized to a whole new level.  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference.  if you are looking for that  it seemed like good qualify.,Fine gauge
-1,"This is a very pretty sweater  a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.",Fine gauge
-1,I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.,Fine gauge

-1,I was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves. from the photo  it looked like full length sleeves. it went back.,Fine gauge
-1,Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey  like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so  it doesn't look at all grey irl.    i'm still recommending because  if you get the right size  and like the colors  it will be a nice  light and comfy swea,Fine gauge
-1,"This top looks great on the model -- a petite frame  small-busted body.  i am 5'2"" and have a large bust and curvy hips. this top hit in all the wrong places. the front looks very cropped and frumpy  if you have a large bust. the width of the top of very boxy.  the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty.",Fine gauge
-1,The pattern and fabric are lovely  but the sleeves are short (unlike the photo) so it drapes very strangely. i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo. had to return this one.,Fine gauge
0,I really wanted to love this sweater after reading the reviews but when i received it i was sadly disappointed. it is pretty boxy and not much shape. could be cute for casual outfits but i was looking for some dressier sweaters.,Fine gauge
0,I ordered the pink  and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft  i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater  it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer  so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.,Fine gauge
0,"This is a very lightweight  comfy sweater jacket. i wanted to love but didn't find it ""special"" enough for the price. i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy. the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front. that look was lost on the medium  though the general fit was better. in the end  the looked medium too sloppy for my taste  and the small felt too small.",Fine gauge
0,I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried  i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy,Fine gauge
0,Unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering. i considered trying a smaller size  but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it.,Fine gauge
0,Love the design with the buttons down the back but unfortunately this did not work for me. the colors were brighter than shown on the website which was my first disappointment  i prefer more muted colors. the second disappointment was the material. for me it was just too itchy. unfortunately  this one's going back.,Fine gauge
0,I love the style of this top. hand washed before wearing and it looks like a rag before i even got to wear it. very disappointed since i thought it would be a very practical tank.,Fine gauge
0,First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.,Fine gauge
0,It's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch. color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted.,Fine gauge
1,Yes  it is big. but it is also amazing. so soft  the colors are great  and the hood  well  the hood makes it. great colors for fall. it's a poncho. it's not supposed to be fitted. i'll be wearing this all fall through winter. love it.,Fine gauge
1,I love this little topper. it is very comfortable. it looks elegant.,Fine gauge
1,"This is a cute sweater  i agree that it's slightly boxy partly because of the side pockets which i think are cute. the yellow is darker than it appears on my screen  more like a mustardy-gold which is not great on my skin tone. i think it's true to size  i got my usual retailer size: xspetite (i'm 34aa  26"" waist) and it fits just right. it's soft and a nice medium weight. on the packaging it was called a bomber  so i'd say it is cut a little like a bomber jacket.",Fine gauge
1,I was really drawn to this burgundy color on this sweater  but wasn't all that impressed with the style. as soon i tried it on  wow it is very flattering. the color is gorgeous  i can see myself using it with jeans  pencil skirts  pants. for reference it does run large  i am usually a x large but i got a large and fits beautifully.,Fine gauge
1,Love this top! it has a great retro vibe  and the colors are great. it is very soft and great quality! i was in between a size xs and small. i went with the small  and wish i had gone with the xs. i would definitely recommend this top!,Fine gauge
1,This is a gorgeous sweater! i purchased it in black and purple.,Fine gauge
1,Haha  the unifying theme in these reviews seems to be don't trust the picture! i was misled by the neckline  i thought i saw a structured kind of asian-inspired mockneck/funnel thing and instead the top has a foldover cowl which  with my full bust underneath it  refuses to pose as a mockneck for me. overall there isn't much structure here at all. but the print is beautiful and the sweater cozy without being itchy.,Fine gauge
1,I love  love  love this sweater.  it is slightly fitted so that is drapes beautifully.  notice it has 3/4 length sleeves which is fine for north caroline where it does not really get cold.  i purchased the blue and i wore it with fitted jeans.,Fine gauge
1,This top is so cute. a little cropped  light for a sweater tank in my opinion  and runs a little big so i sized down one size. beautiful fabric and fit  the ruffles are such a fun addition! definitely recommend with a high waisted pant or skirt for work - so cute!,Fine gauge

-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b",Intimates
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates

0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,Intimates
0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.,Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates
0,It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however  i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight  perhaps that might help with the fit?,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
0,I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.,Intimates
0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
0,I love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin  not as great. so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished.,Intimates
1,I love this robe and can't wait to wear it while i'm getting ready for my upcoming wedding. the only con that i can see is that the sleeves are a bit baggy  but other than that it's perfect!,Intimates

1,Makes me feel like a sexy ice skater. true to size  i am 5'0 and 120 lb and both the small and medium fit. i kept the medium. love it!,Intimates
1,Looks exactly as it does in the pictures. very comfortable  loose flowing  and has a slip underneath it. i'm personally a little hesitant to buy clothes online because it's always a guessing game when it comes to figuring out what size. with that  i have wide hips/big thighs so i tend to vary between medium and large  but thankfully the medium fits like a glove!,Intimates
1,I've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear. this is a light weight bra  could be a little more supportive. pretty color  with nice lines. only downside is the retailer tag on the back - itchy (i need to remove it.),Intimates
1,This bra is so soft and comfortable i feel like i'm not wearing a bra at all  except i have the gentle support i need. the material is very thin and the pink color is see through  so not recommended under a white or see through shirt. perfect for sleeping or lounging in!,Intimates
1,Love this chemise. the lace detail is cute  the length of the skirt is longer than many of the night gowns you'd find in the cute  not frumpy category  and overall it is super soft and comfortable for lounging and sleeping. bought the large  and i'm normally around a size 8-10  between medium and large depending on the cut of the item. the large is slightly on the big size  so the straps move around when i sleep. not a big deal for me  so i kept it.,Intimates
1,I honestly just love the hanky panky brand. i know it sometimes feels a little extravagant to purchase their lingerie  but the quality  fit and style are so good that it is absolutely worth it. this piece is no exception. i don't normally purchase lingerie like this  but saw this chemise and decided to try it. just as the other pieces from this brand  it's comfortable and gorgeous- so high quality and classy. it's a great cut  the fabric is clearly lace  but beautifully done. and the feel is lov,Intimates
1,I was so excited to receive this in the mail. it fits true to size and is extremely flattering. so glad that i made this purchase,Intimates
-1,I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss  copper and burgundy. they are soft  well-fitting  pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material  and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better  but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials  this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.,Jackets
-1,Should have listened 2 a previous review! while this is a very well made garment  it really does remind me of a bathrobe  and will be returning :( too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great. also...this runs very large. the extra small was more like a medium.,Jackets
-1,I ordered this vest in xxs  since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then  the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big  not artfully drapey.,Jackets
-1,This jacket was cute  however  i am normally a large with a bit of room to spare.  this has the irritating issue of not fitting under the arms and across the chest and shoulders.  it is not my shape as most other brands at retailer fit me. this jacket is not sized correctly.,Jackets
-1,"Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the ""captain kangaroo"" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.",Jackets
-1,"Runs extremely large. i got an xs and am 5'4"" 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5'6"" and above. very disappointed with the size. the quality of the fabric wasn't great either. i wanted it to work so bad but just didn't!",Jackets
-1,I have blazers in size 8 from this designer and they fit with room to spare. i understand this is a more fitted style  but it is still way too small. size 10 and size 12 were not much bigger. great colors and cute design  but just too small even if you do not plan on buttoning it. i hope they bring back this jacket but make it true to size.,Jackets
-1,This is the tiniest blazer i've ever purchased in a size 10. i usually wear an 8  but sized up based on other reviews and it was still too small. it's very attractive but please size true to size,Jackets
-1,I'm returning this jacket. i tried it on after it was delivered  and was happy with the weight  cut  and color  although it's more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture. however  the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt  it will last very long. i actually can't get the zipper to zip at all. it's very rough and lightweight  and i'm afraid if i keep trying to force it i'll just end up breaking it. sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality.   thi,Jackets
0,I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however  the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also  the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.,Jackets
0,"The kimono is as pictured. the colors are true to what is shown on line  though the description indicates ""green multi""--it is not green. i returned the item  however. the quality is fine  but it seemed extremely over-priced to me. it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality.",Jackets
0,I was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it. it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasn't what i was searching for. this sweater  like on the model  is quite large. although i wanted a large sweater  the fit of this one didn't fit well on me. it has more of a boxy feel to it. i usually wear a medium  but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me. i,Jackets
0,This jacket is cozy  warm  and very cute  but after the 1st washing (according to the manufacturer's instructions) it began to pill and has worsened each time.,Jackets
0,Very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and couldn't zip up the 8 (am a 36c and thick/broad at the top) as there is no give. this is also more like a fitted shirt  made of lightweight muslin-like fabric. was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly  air conditioned office setting so sadly it didn't work for me. could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami.,Jackets
0,I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter  thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing  more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don't think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely.,Jackets
0,The vest looks  so stylish on. it makes a regular t shirt look edgy with it on. i love the vest but the price is too high,Jackets
0,I snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring. it is very delicate and i can't wear it when i'm with my kids because they pull on it so much! it will just me by night out wrap i guess!!!,Jackets
0,I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also  it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal,Jackets
1,Great looking jacket with attitude. the color is more like a faded black or deep charcoal grey. i'm usually a large petite but this is snug in the chest. luckily it's a knit so i can make it work by zipping it partway and leaving the top half open.,Jackets
1,When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it  upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places  the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!,Jackets
1,The sherpa vest i received from retailer was the color the model is wearing.. the same hue and shade of both the faux shearliing and faux leather. i'm very satisfied with the vest. i believe it runs a bit large. i usually wear a large  sometimes an extra large yet the m/l fit me fine. shearling is very in this year and this will complete your look-wearing either pants or skirts.,Jackets
1,I love this jacket. it's the prettiest and most stylish jean jacket i've ever owned. the sleeves run small. i'm an xs but chose a small so i can button it and wear thin sweaters underneath.,Jackets
1,I was walking by my local retailer and saw this in the window and loved the colors. it's a great combination and looks good with white jeans  and regular denim. i like the cuffs on the sleeves and the textured material. it is a kimono - so in essence it is not form fitting. it's meant to flow over whatever else you have on. i purchased the xs/s and i am a normal size 2 and it looks cute. i got lots of compliments when i wore it! there are slits on either side at the bottom hem as well which allow,Jackets
1,This jacket is totally adorable. i wore it with a man tailored shirt with the color up and the sleeves poking out. it has a great swing to it and is very comfortable! it is sized perfectly. and i got it on sale!!!,Jackets
1,I love the look and design of this piece but the fit is awkward. the m gapes open and is much boxier than it looks on the model but the s is too tight in the elbows. i think i might have to return it :(,Jackets
1,A fabulous light weight jacket. love the detail and fit is perfect and comfortable. the jacket was not so interesting on the display table but once tried on it became mine and i suspect this is going to sell out. i really love the light color denim trim on the lapels. a keeper!  i purchased a medium and that is my standard size in retailer jackets.  for reference: 34 dd  and 145 pounds and 5'4 height.,Jackets
1,This jacket was a little shorter than i had expected  but i still really enjoy the cut and fit of it.,Jackets
-1,These run very small!! they are also short  almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.,Jeans
-1,I've never had a problem with pilcro jeans. i own several pairs. however  i ordered my regular size 28 (i'm 5'3  120 pounds) and not only were these jeans thin  they had zero stretch and after 1 hour of wear stretched out horribly. they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean.,Jeans
-1,Love the fit of the jeans just wish there was a couple more inches at the bottom:) these jeans have a 23 inch inseam not 26  so they hit at a very odd place on my calf- return. for reference i'm 5'8 ,Jeans
-1,I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer  actually)  the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion  and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small  but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a,Jeans
-1,Bummer  i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can't bare to wear them anymore.,Jeans
-1,"Woah  these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash  the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3"" / 140 curvy. no  no  no!",Jeans
-1,I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year  similar to these  so when i saw this fun pair  i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.    they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so  so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.    i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time,Jeans
-1,"If these jeans work for you  you're a lucky girl! the fabric is really thick and soft. pocket detail is cool and the hidden multicolored button placket is a nice detail. i ordered down a size. they're tight across my thighs and seem shorter than a 30"" inseam. the fit is boxy and not flattering on me but pants are so cute i may keep them anyway.",Jeans
-1,The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.,Jeans
0,I have been looking for flares that are not tight through the thigh and these are definitely them...but for me they were so long that to hem them would ruin the style of the pants. i'm 5'5 and have long legs but i would need a high heel to maintain the intended style  and that's not what i was looking for. otherwise  beautiful.,Jeans
0,Very nice fabric but disappointed in the stitching on the knees. it looks nice but makes the pants very uncomfortable and tight around the knees. too bad because i love the style and hoped they would work!,Jeans
0,The fit on these is good for my hourglass shape  and the fabric quality and comfort is good too.i think the rinse is just not as nice in person- the orange stitching is pretty bright too. i bought. a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality  fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these. i am going to return these and see if they have something better   but will only buy in store from now on.,Jeans
0,Lots of pairs of the pilcro serif-- and for some reason  after 5mo or less of normal wear  these have bit the dust.   i don't dry my denim and do wash on gentle cycles... this pair just doesn't seem to be too happy. began pilling after two washes  just seems to be a different blend of fabric than the others?     super bummed and now there's no way to replace it. wamp wamp.,Jeans

0,I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body  straight up and down  i ordered 2 sizes down  but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter  not blue  and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair  but  for me  because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.,Jeans
0,I absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans. i did have to size down. i ran into problems after washing. the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other  looking very unbalanced. after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying. the other leg did not have this stitching  thus the fraying double in size. i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair. these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc,Jeans
1,"I bought these pants in the wine color and i love them! i found them to be true to size. i always wear a 27 in pilcro and these were no exception. i am finding the cropped flare silhouette to be so versatile. they are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am 5'3"" but i think i prefer this. these pants can easily be dressed up or down - have worn with a dressy top and heels as well as a denim shirt and ballet flats. super cute!",Jeans

-1,I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute  but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call  but if i had bought it for myself  it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed  so that remains to be seen.,Knits

-1,I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee  it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet,Legwear

0,I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.,Lounge

-1,I love relaxed-fit wide leg pants with some pockets and draw string  so naturally i was super excited to see these. i got them in gray and they felt and looked perfect right out of the bag  material was soft and flowy but not too thin. unfortunately the sizing is completely off unless i got a defective pair  i got my usual size l and they felt like s or smaller  i barely could get them on and i could not zip up. i'd need at least two sizes larger for them to fit at all. very disappointed  will l,Pants
0,The embroidery on the side is cute  and they're nice and airy for hot days. however  the stitching on the legs unraveled after only two washes. also  they're extremely long; i'm 5'7 and had to take them up around 3 inches.,Pants
0,I love these pants but be care when you do laundry. the dye transferred to another pair of pilcro chinos that was a little lighter color. very frustrating. label mentioned it but i only noticed after it happened because the colors are both not that dark at all.,Pants
0,I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size  cute  and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot  but back to the store they went.,Pants
0,I so wanted to love this jumpsuit but unfortunately the fit is so off. it runs small and the crotch is to high. the color is beautiful and the design is great. it's really sad i waited two months for this and it was definitely not worth the wait.,Pants
0,These ran true to size  but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving. i'm athletic and have lean legs  but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh. and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric. i loved how they fit at the waist  but the legs just didn't work for me. sadly returning these.,Pants
0,"I tried these on in the store  and they are super cute but run small. i typically wear a size 25 (i'm 5' 5"" and 108 lbs.) and they were too tight for me. i like the fabric and the cut; i think they'd be great one size up. (my store didn't have them.)",Pants
0,Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.,Pants
0,I was so excited to receive this romper. it's a great material  but it's actually a bit drab. the colors are very bland and the flowers just hang. it's not flattering as it is very roomy.,Pants
0,"I bought these in the blue. i sized down  as other reviewers mentioned  going for an xs. i'm 5'5"" and about 130lbs and would usually buy a small. at 5'5"" the length was too long for me  hitting me below my ankles  rather than how shown on the model. strike 1. then  i felt the material was pretty thin - strike 2. and lastly  they hung a little funny on me  rather than being a bit loose like jogging pants should be - strike 3. despite the great sale price  these went back!",Pants
1,"Love love this piece! for the moment i saw it i noted anther catalog  i knew i had to try it on... im 5' 9"" and 130 and the xs fits me perfectly. i love the way it is tailored. it is also lined with a nice fabric. overall a very well made summer go to piece!",Pants
1,These pants are made of a beautiful fabric that really brings out the rich color. like others have said they fit almost like high-waisted leggings  which i for one love. it makes them really comfortable while the nice  heavy fabric and lovely tailoring make it appropriate for an office. i do find that the pockets are pretty useless  as having anything in them ruins the lines of the trousers. the zipper is a bit pokey as well.,Pants
1,I am in love with this piece! i am long waisted and large busted so finding a jumpsuit to fit me can be challenging  having said that i sized up when ordering this  wrong ladies....no need....i had to reorder my normal size and even that was roomy  but in a good way as i prefer belting it with my huge concho belts. i purchased it in the rasberry and i am still scratching my head as to why the black sold first  the red is stunning and i find it more versatile going from casual to dressy. and this,Pants
1,This feels and looks like a ballet skirt on  so light and flowy  super comfortable  just love it! extremely flattering cut  tiny gathered folds at waistband add pretty detail and create a slimming effect on my tummy  what's not to love?! great pockets too! i have a 34 inseam and the length is perfect. ordering in both colors now as i can see these becoming my go to bottoms all summer long....,Pants
1,I love these pants! waited for them to go on sale and totally worth the price. i wore them work and received numerous compliments. great for casual friday at work or sunday brunch with the girls. can't go wrong with antro!,Pants
1,These pants are fabulous. the flow and feel made my mind up easily to purchase these. i have a long torso and short muscular legs. the style complimented by body type. being culottes  the hem should probably fall higher up on my legs. i will probably have them hemmed. the pleat has a nice kick to it. now off to find the right pair of shoes...,Pants
1,"I've been searching for wide leg trousers for what seems like years. and finally  i have found them--and on sale!! i agree that these trousers are long for ladies of average height. i am fairly tall (5'8"") and the length is perfect for me. i don't anticipate that i will have them hemmed. i really love the detail of the tie waist. one could wear these with or without the ribbon belt. i would say that the button closures are a bit less than substantial for the quality and weight of the fabric. i s",Pants
1,"I received tons of compliments on this adorable jumper and felt like i was wearing comfy pajamas. i wore it to a baby shower and it was a hit. i'm 5'4"" and it was a bit long and needed to be hemmed  otherwise it's perfect!",Pants
1,I purchased the violet chino's in my local store. the color to me is more plum than violet but a nice shade still. the fit was perfect and they are oh so comfortable. i bought size 27 (weight fluxes 116-118). i can see having several pairs of these in other colors because of the comfort level and they work for fall  spring and summer. in the warmer states even winter. the fabric has a soft feel to it.,Pants
-1,"I'm 140 at 5' 8"". pear shape. the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didn't lay flat. loose on leg opening - which i liked. but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider. i got a medium",Shorts
-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.,Shorts
-1,It was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didn't live up to my expectations. i'm 5'3  115 and got a s. it looked odd on me...a little too short on the bottom  a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price. i returned it.,Shorts
-1,I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly  no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands  bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short  but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them  they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer  plus a delicate cycle  no dryer. the lace is man,Shorts
-1,The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester.     also  this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.    i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.,Shorts
-1,This pants the worst short that i ever had!!  i bought ;this short last week and i laundry it yesterday and it came out lost color!!  i was really shock definetly will return it to store.  fyi  i never use chrolox or bleach when i laundry.,Shorts
-1,Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest  this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!,Shorts
-1,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.,Shorts
-1,"I was so excited to try these  it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4"" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee.",Shorts
0,"I adore eva franco but these are just not thoughtfully designed regarding fit. i wear a size 12 and took the risk of ordering the 12 as a popback  but they do fit 1-2 sizes small. i could get them zipped but it's not a good look. i feel like the waist would fit if the rise weren't so short. for reference  i have a 33"" waist and 42"" hips.",Shorts
0,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,Shorts
0,This romper is extremely well made and the colors are even more beautiful in person.  however  i found it to run extremely short in the torso.  i couldn't get my arms through the sleeves after stepping into it without ripping the garment.  for reference i'm 5'9 with a slightly longer than average torso.  i ordered my normal size m.,Shorts
0,Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall ,Shorts
0,There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.,Shorts
0,I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist)  so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear  but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o,Shorts
0,These run very large.  i wear a 25 or 26 in paige jeans  and the 25 in these shorts were way too big.  i fear if i got the 24 they would be a little short.,Shorts
0,When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on,Shorts
0,"I wanted to love this romper  but it just wasted right for me. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and ordered size small. i may have liked it better with more room in the medium  decided to return. i still recommend trying this product  but it wasn't for me and my hips!",Shorts
1,I happened upon a pair of these shorts that someone had returned. they are the perfect length. they are very well made. i have worn them to my son's baseball game and the sec tournament. they are tailored and have an interesting design. they make me look as though i have lost ten pounds. i am thrilled with them.,Shorts
1,I love these. i like that they're fancier than your basic summer shorts but they still look casual and effortless. unlike the other reviews i found that they run large. i'm usually a 4  maybe a 6  and the 4 is roomy.  still looks good though just rides a bit lower on my hips.,Shorts
1,These shorts are very well made and the embroidery work is beautiful. the dark yellow is a little bit more orangy looking than in the pictures  but is still a pretty color. don't expect any give or stretch with these shorts.,Shorts
1,The fabric quality and style are amazing. the fabric is very high quality and so soft and the style is nice for an adult. i generally don't wear shorts because of length  style and other problems but i can wear these without feeling like a high schooler. i usually wear a 24/00 in pants  i ordered the 0 and was worried that it would be too loose and look sloppy on me but it fits amazingly. one of my favorite purchases ever!!!,Shorts
1,Love these shorts! not too tight and not too short! they match so many tops! tts for my hard to fit figure! great for weekends  vacations  and just to be adorable in!,Shorts
1,This jumper is so cute  it is soft  and you can dress it up or down depending on where your going.,Shorts
1,I wore out a pair of level 99 shorts a couple of years ago. ordered these in the same size and they are huge. so i am sending them in for exchange and hope i'm guessing right. linen and tencel are my two favorite summer fabrics. love the length which can be adjusted by rolling. good pockets. gorgeous somewhat dusty plum color. belt loops if needed though i rather hope they're not.,Shorts
1,I got the shorts and the blue motif they're really comfortable and will look cute with a tank top for the weekend.   they true to size them usually a size 4 to 6 and i got a small and that works.,Shorts
1,These shorts are comfortable and are just the right length. i have the blue and it isn't as bright as shown in the pictures  but it's a great color nonetheless that coordinates well with many wardrobe items. when i tried on my usual 25  i found the waist fit a bit snug so i bought the 26 for a comfortable fit. i should've stayed with my usual size though  because after wearing for an entire day  the shorts loosened up quite a bit and developed a saggy look to them. i'm so disappointed with this,Shorts
-1,"I would say the skirt runs two sizes too small. i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews  i purchased a large. i could barely get the skirt over my hips. even if it fit in the waist  it was much too short on me and i'm 5'2"". it's a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween.",Skirts

(i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge  hip-y  and bunchy. yuck.,Skirts

-1,I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red  as well! however  this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.,Skirts
-1,For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words  i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist  it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir,Skirts
-1,If i could sew  i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however  this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well)  but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of,Skirts
0,"I tried on the grey version in store  and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee  which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5'4"" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however  the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable.",Skirts
0,I fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite. it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything. it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me. it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just didn't lay down well  bunching out on the sides in a way i didn't find to be very flattering. so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm  but 3 stars for actual fit on. alas it is going,Skirts
0,This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other  giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered.,Skirts

0,I loved these on the hanger when i saw them in the store. i liked the fabric  but found the full cut of the pant added a ton of bulk to my hips (and i don't have big hips). i also thought the waist was a bit snug while the rest of the pant ran tts. they went back.,Skirts
0,I usually wear an 8  which wasn't available  and sized up to the 10 which fit just fine as there is no stretch and it's a set-in waist band. the fabric is pretty  the skirt is fully lined  the length is not too short  and the only thing i don't like is the big bronzey toothed zipper - it looks ok on the beige version  but on the black it stands out.    it's perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays.,Skirts

1,This skirt was too big so i returned it but did like it well enough to re-order. quality seems average; my only complaint is the lining seems too short for the skirt. why  on a maxi  is the slip lining a mini? the first thing my husband said was that it needed a slip. he didn't think it had one as he could see through the skirt to my knees. this is very lightweight fabric but could be worn all year around depending on the leg wear that is worn with it. it is a very versatile piece which is why i,Skirts

1,This skirt is great and you can't beat it for the price. it fits more like a pencil skirt on me  and looks sort of a-line on the model. very nice work appropriate skirt. though the slit comes higher than i expected. my thighs are tattooed so i put on some black tights and it looks great with a blouse and cardigan!,Skirts
1,This skirt is a nice medium weight and is lined. my normal size 4 fit perfect. i only wish it was available in petites. if you are petite  the skirt is ankle length. but this is a good skirt to wear to work.,Skirts
1,Ok  so maybe i am too picky because the pattern is lovely  the colors are great  the fabric is quality  the fit is flattering  the sizing is appropriate. that said  the high to low hemline shows the inner fabric so it kinda stands out when you are moving and i find it distracting so unfortunately i am returning it. sizing reference  i wear a size 8/10 in pants  i'm 5'3 and the medium petite fit comfortably.,Skirts
1,The is such a cute a-line skirt and perfect for the summer with a white tee. i bought the moss color and the rose gold buttons on it look really pretty. i'm 5'1  103 pounds and bought the 00 regular since i did not want to go too short with the petite size. it does run slightly big so order a size down if you have a smaller waist. love this and the price!,Skirts
1,Saw this skirt in the store  but the size was wrong. i am normally a 0 or 2 at retailer  but i was afraid that the 2 would be just too much material  so i ordered the 0  and boy  am i glad. elegant  can go from day to night with the right shoes and accessories. anticipating many compliments.,Skirts
1,Tried this skirt on in the store and loved it...so pretty feminine and versatile except for the color.. although its a gorgeous color and i do love red how often do people wear red skirts? i would have snatched it up if it were offered in other colors. unlike the other reviewer i think the ruching is great as it gives you the option to wear the skirt higher or lower on your waist and adds the axtra interest factor. as this would be a totally frivolous buy i'm going to resist and try to wait for,Skirts
-1,I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,Sleep

1,This dress is very soft and comfy but transparency is an issue. having said that  i think as long as you wear flesh-colored undergarments you'd be fine in a casual situation. the natural fiber is especially comfortable and the detailed stitching around the neck and chest area is pretty. my store didn't have petite sizes and the regular length was too long for me so i passed on it.,Sleep
1,I like this robe a lot. the tassel detailing on the ties is beautiful. i like the soft interior-but wish it went all the way down the arms. the cozy part of the robe is only in the center section and hood-the arms can be a bit chilly while the rest of you is warm and cozy.  i do not think the robe is necessarily flattering  in that it does not do me favors in the way of slimming  it is more of a cozy-around-the-house robe rather than one to hide lingerie underneath.,Sleep
-1,What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point  i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead  i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s  made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.,Sweaters

-1,This is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it  and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide.     even when i was 9-1/2 months pregnant  the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i'm back to about a size 10-12  this looks like jared from subway's pre-weight-loss pants  in sweater form. ridiculous!,Sweaters
-1,This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy  and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price  but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos  but unfortunately in person were not quality garments.,Sweaters

-1,If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest  this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition  but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone  and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy.,Sweaters
-1,This looks so gorgeous on the model on the site  so i ordered it online. it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on. looks like i took a floor rug  cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head. the sweater itself is so pretty  its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me. i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs/s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs. its kind of itchy too. will be returning this asap.,Sweaters

0,This sweater runs true to size. i am 5'7' and 125 lbs and ordered the small. it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle. it is a well made  heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm. if you like the feel of wool  buy it. if not  pass on it.,Sweaters
0,I really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly can't now. i was attracted to the softness  simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it. wrinkles  pills and loses shape quickly. if you still want to get it  consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you. this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size. the styling is excellent--very versatile. but the yarn is too delicate and fussy.,Sweaters

1,When i saw this online  it looked like a regular cardigan with a hood  but with looser arms and a generally looser fit. just be aware it has bat wings or something (not sure what it is called). there isn't one picture included with an arm lifted  so without a really close look  the arms look loose  but normal. i returned it :(,Sweaters
1,I loved this when i saw it online. tried it on in the store  and though it is beautiful  it's a lot of sweater. its a a bit heavy in weight  the buttons on the collar give you the option to wear it up or open as shown in the picture. the problem was that when it was open the big button loop hung down right in front. that was probably the determining factor against purchasing it. if it goes on sale i may reconsider.,Sweaters
1,"This sweater is super cute with the mock neck. i love all 3 colors. i typically wear either an xs or s in retailer sweaters  and purchased a s in this one. now that i've put it on again at home  i'm wondering if i should have sized up to a m mainly due to the sleeves and hem of the sweater being short. i'm 5'6"" (and 126 lbs)  so not overly tall and don't typically have this issue. i feel like the model (who is likely taller than me) has to have on at least a size l and have the sweater pinned back",Sweaters

-1,Just not cute. i don't know how else to describe this top. i am a 34dd and ordered a large. it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am. i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn't in store so i returned.,Swim
-1,I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.,Swim
-1,This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also  the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top  the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable,Swim

-1,The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded  which is nice i suppose  but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd  size 8 in pants  and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso  which probably didn't help.,Swim
